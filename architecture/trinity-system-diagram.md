## Description

- **Integrity Gatekeeper (A)** – Initial reflection intake using structured question sets.
- **Data Parser (B)** – Transforms answers, biometrics, or audio into analyzable formats.
- **Signal Analysis Engine (C)** – Identifies emotional, behavioral, and relational patterns.
- **Ethical Scoring Logic (D)** – Applies rules to determine alignment, risk, or burnout.
- **Feedback Loop Generator (E)** – Sends insights or warnings back to users or admins.
- **DAO Decision Layer (F)** – Allows verified stakeholders to vote or intervene.
- **Storage Layer (G)** – All events, scores, and transcripts are versioned and stored securely.

This visual system can be extended or modularized as Trinity OS grows.
